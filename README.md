# Data sorting and filtering

Read the 3 input files reports.json, reports.csv, reports.xml and output a combined CSV file with the following characteristics:

- The same column order and formatting as reports.csv
- All report records with packets-serviced equal to zero should be excluded
- records should be sorted by request-time in ascending order

Additionally, the application should print a summary showing the number of records in the output file associated with each service-guid.

## Solution

Solved using **Apache Commons CSV**, **simple-json** and **DOM**. **TreeMap** used as auxiliar data structure. More information in documentation pdf file.
